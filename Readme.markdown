## fetch flickr
* * *
This is a Sinatra app that fetches flickr phtotos.  
My goal was to get familiar with the flickr api.  
For the view I'm using haml. By clicking on the pictures  
you will get a nice animation for changing size. For  
that I'm using the jQuery plugin fancybox.  

Checkout the running application at heroku  
[fierce-winter-655.heroku.com/](http://fierce-winter-655.heroku.com/)

If you want to install the app by yourself you have  
to get our own API key
