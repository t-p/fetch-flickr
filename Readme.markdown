## fetch flickr
* * *
This is a Sinatra app that fetches flickr photos.  
My goal was to get familiar with the flickr api.  


Checkout the running application at heroku  
[fetch-flickr.heroku.com](https://fetch-flickr.heroku.com/)  

or at anynines.com  
[fetch-flickr.de.a9sapp.eu](http://fetch-flickr.de.a9sapp.eu)

If you want to install the app by yourself you have  
to get our own API key
